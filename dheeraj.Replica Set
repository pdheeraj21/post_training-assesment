A common use-case, where we will use a daemon set instead of replica set.

Replica Set will ensure that the number of pods (defined in our config file) is always running in our cluster. 
Does not matter in which worker node they are running.

Daemon Set will ensure that one copy of pod defined in our configuration will always be available on every worker node.

a common use case would be the voting application (But a much larger scale) that we previosly used for example the total count of votes would be kept on each worker node.
even if a pod dies the count at that moment remains intact in the other worker
if we would have used a replica set that the count would be back to null.
